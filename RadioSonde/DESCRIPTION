Description: RadioSonde is a collection of programs for reading and
        plotting SKEW-T,log p diagrams and wind profiles for data
        collected by radiosondes (the typical weather balloon-borne
        instrument), which we will call "flights", "sondes", or
        "profiles" throughout the associated documentation.  The raw
        data files are in a common format that has a header followed by
        specific variables.  Use "help(ExampleSonde)" for the full
        explanation of the data files.
